        <h1>Internal CSS</h1>
        <!--El CSS interno implica incrustar reglas CSS directamente dentro de un documento HTML.-->
        <p>
            The most used CSS forms for renovating, styling, and altering the distinctive characteristics
            of a particular web page is internal CSS. By using the “style” element in the “head” section 
            of an HTML web page, you can utilise the internal CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            Reusing the code makes it simple to add styles like groups or ID numbers. The drawback of 
            utilising an internal stylesheet would be that modifications only affect the page where 
            the code is inserted.   
        </p>
        <h2>Advantages and Disadvantages of Internal CSS</h2>
        <h3>Advantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    You can include CSS in HTML texts by utilising a type of CSS known as internal CSS. 
                    A single HTML web page’s layout can be designed, and styles can be modified within 
                    the HTML code. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>You need not upload several files because the code will only be added to one HTML file.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Developers create cascading style sheets to specify a style, and by just referring 
                    to that CSS file, they can use that style across multiple pages. As a result, styling 
                    effort is reduced, and repetition is done away with. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The designer can use earlier functions that weren’t specified in the HTML that was 
                    used to create the web pages. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The forms within external style sheets become overruled by internal or embedded 
                    styles. Internal CSS stands second in the priority list after Inline CSS. 
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Disadvantages</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    When we use the head section to encompass all the styles we desire, the code will 
                    have more lines. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The same styling code would need to be written at the beginning of every site page 
                    if you wanted the same styling across each page. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Internal CSS is only useful for HTML websites with a single page.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    The most popular technique to apply CSS is to retain the style in external CSS files
                    since internal CSS is not ideal for large projects when more than one web page is required. 
                </p>
