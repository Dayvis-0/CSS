        <h1>Handling conflicts</h1>
        <h2>Conflicts rules</h2>
        <p>
            Stylesheets cascade. At a very simple level, this means that the origin and the order of 
            CSS rules matter. When two rules both have equal specificity, the one that is defined last 
            in the stylesheet is the one that will be used.
        </p>
        <h4>Example cascade</h4>
        <h2>Specificity</h2>
        <p>
            Specificity is an algorithm that the browser uses to decide which property value is applied 
            to an element.
        </p>
        <p>Specificity is basically a measure of how specific a selector's selection will be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A type (element) selector is less specific;  it will select all elements of that 
                    type that appear on a page, so it has less weight. 
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    A type (element) selector is less specific; it will select only the elements on a 
                    page that have a specific class attribute value, so it has more weight.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    An ID selector is even more specific; it only selects a single element with a 
                    specific id value. It therefore has even more weight.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Inheritance</h2>
        <p>
            Inheritance also needs to be understood in this context — some CSS property values set 
            on parent elements are inherited by their child elements, and some aren't.
        </p>
        <h2>Understanding inheritance</h2>
        <ul class="main">
            <li>Item One</li>
            <li>
                Item Two
                <ul>
                    <li>2.1</li>
                    <li>2.2</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Item Three
                <ul class="special">
                    <li>
                        3.1
                        <ul>
                            <li>3.1.1</li>
                            <li>3.1.2</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>3.2</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Properties like <code>width</code> (as mentioned earlier), <code>margin</code>, <code>padding</code>, 
            and <code>border</code> are not inherited properties. If a border were to be inherited by 
            the children in this list example, every single list and list item would gain a 
            border — robably not an effect we would ever want!
        </p>
        <h3>Controlling inheritance</h3>
        <p>
            CSS provides five special universal property values for controlling inheritance. Every CSS 
            property accepts these values.
        </p>
        <code>inherit</code>
        <p>
            Sets the property value applied to a selected element to be the same as that of its parent element.
        </p>
        <code>initial</code>
        <p>
            Sets the property value applied to a selected element to the initial value of that property.
        </p>
        <code>revert</code>
        <p>
            Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the browser's default styling 
            rather than the defaults applied to that property. This value acts like unset in many cases.
        </p>
        <code>revert-layer</code>
        <p>
            Resets the property value applied to a selected element to the value established in a 
            previous cascade layer.
        </p>
        <code>unset</code>
        <p>
            Resets the property to its natural value, which means that if the property is naturally 
            inherited it acts like inherit, otherwise it acts like initial.
        </p>
