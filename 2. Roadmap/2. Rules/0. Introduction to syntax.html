        <h1>Introduction to syntax: declarations, rulesets, and statements</h1>
        <p>
            The basic goal of the Cascading Stylesheet (CSS) language is to allow a browser engine to 
            paint elements of the page with specific features, like colors, positioning, or decorations.
            The CSS syntax reflects this goal and its basic building blocks are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>The <strong>property</strong> which is an identifier.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The <strong>value</strong> which describe how the feature must be handled by the engine.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>CSS declarations</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <img 
                src="Images/CSS_declarations.png" 
                alt="A css declaration is a property value pair, with a colon separating the two entities and a semi-colon closing the declaration."
                width="442"
                height="189"
            >
        </div>
        <h2>CSS declaration blocks</h2>
        <img 
            src="Images/CSS_declarations_blocks.png" 
            alt="Two braces delimit the start and end of a CSS block, with css content or no content between the braces."
            width="312"
            height="222"
        >
        <p>A CSS declaration block is visualized in the diagram below.</p>
        <div class="box">
            <img 
                src="Images/declaration_block.png" 
                alt="Within a CSS block, encompassed in braces, semicolons separate declarations, with the final semicolon being optional but recommended as good practice."
                height="244"
            >
        </div>
        <h2>CSS rulesets</h2>
        <p>A CSS ruleset (or rule) is visualized in the diagram below.</p>
        <div class="box">
            <img 
                src="Images/CSS_rulesets.png" 
                alt="A group of comma-separated selectors precedes the brace-delimited declaration block, which contains multiple declarations ending in semicolons."
                height="200"
            >
        </div>
        <h2>CSS statements</h2>
        <div class="box">
            <img 
                src="Images/CSS_statements.png" 
                alt="A Venn diagram of statements noting all rulesets are nested statements, while some at-rules are nested statements but most aren't. Anything that is not an at-rule or nested is invalid."
            >
        </div>
        <p>There are two kinds of statements:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>Rulesets</strong> (or rules) that, as seen, associate a collection of CSS declarations 
                    to a condition described by a selector.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    <strong>At-rules</strong> At-rules that start with an at sign, @, followed by an 
                    identifier and then continuing up to the end of the statement, that is up to the 
                    next semicolon (;) outside of a block, or the end of the next block.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any statement which isn't a ruleset or an at-rule is invalid and ignored.</p>
